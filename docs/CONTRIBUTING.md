# Work on Matcha

We made Matcha open source so that it could be extended easily

The work on Matcha itself falls into multiple major areas :

## Contributing code
Fix a bug, or add a new feature. You can make a pull request and see your code in the next version of Django.

## Writing documentation

Documentation is a work in process job.
If you want to improve documentation, you can make a pull request.

Currently, documentation is only avaibable in french

## Localizing Matcha

Mathcha is using i18n and l10n subframeworks for localizations of various parts of frontend and backend.
