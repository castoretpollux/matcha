# Terminology

**Note: all terms are shown in italics and bold**.

Matcha is a tool for using AI-based tools.
AIs “transform” an input of one type into another.

Well-known examples are :

- LLMs, which enable text TO text processing
- Image generators for text TO image.

These tools are frequently specialized for a certain type of ***input*** and a certain type of ***output***.

**Matcha overcomes this constraint:**

- It is possible to create conversation ***sessions***.
- These ***sessions*** contain ***request*** messages and ***response*** messages.
- The generation of a response ***message*** from a request ***message*** (or more generally, from all previous ***messages*** in the ***session***) is the responsibility of a ***pipeline***.
- The ***pipelines*** can be “static”, available immediately when Matcha is launched.
- But they can also be “dynamic” and have been generated by a ***factory***.
- ***pipelines*** and ***factories*** are implemented in the ***machinery*** folder
- Among the possible ***inputs***, it is possible to use ***documents***.
- These documents are ***vectorized*** and the ***vectors*** are stored in a database (PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension) and can be searched, enabling ***RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)***.

**Additional information:**

- The ***pipelines*** are not limited to a single, simple input; they can take in several pieces of data at the same time.
- On the front end, this is reflected in the display of a ***form***.
- The ***form*** associated with a ***pipeline*** is defined by a ***schema*** (in this case, Pydantic).
- When a ***pipeline*** has processed all the inputs, it generates a response in JSON, which is then transformed by a ***renderer*** that can generate :
    - plain text
    - HTML
    - or any other type of data
