# Matcha

Matcha is a high-level frontend and API server that helps to combine multiple AI and scripts, providing a prototyping tool thru a single web interface while respecting users access and data privacy.

While many tools are "multi-modal", it is designed to be "multi-model".

It is developped and maintained by a french Web Agency : [Castor & Pollux](https://www.castoretpollux.com/)

It is aimed to be wildly extensible by developping custom "pipelines" and "factories" to create interfaces with existing AI models that are available on HuggingFace, Replicate or any AI related platform.

Matcha is conceptually similar to LangChain, but LangChain focuses on developpers whereas Matcha focuses on end-users without forgetting developpers.

All documentation is in the [docs](/docs) directory. If you're just getting started,
here's how we recommend you read the docs:

- First, read [INSTALLATION](/docs/INSTALLATION.md) for instructions on installing Matcha locally.
- Then, read [TERMINOLOGY](/docs/TERMINOLOGY.md) to understand the concepts.
- Next, read the [CONFIGURATION](/docs/CONFIGURATION.md) to fit your Matcha instance to your needs.
- If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read
  [DEPLOYMENT](/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for instructions. But we advice to read [ARCHITECTURE](/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) before to understand how everything works.

Docs are updated regularly. If you find any problems in the docs, or think
they should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a
ticket here: [issues](https://github.com/castoretpollux/matcha/issues)
